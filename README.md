# pytorch-deep-image-matting

Non-official pytorch implementation of [deep image matting](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Xu_Deep_Image_Matting_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf)

### Performance
* Test with method whole and max_size=1600.
* training epoch = 25.
* SAD normalized by 1000.
* best epoch is the epoch of the best result while training.
* input img is normalized by mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225].
* erode the alpha for trimap as well as dialte(for 0 and 1 balance) & crop the patch based on the center point(randomly selected from where alpha > 0 and alpha < 1)
* The performance is close to paper.

### Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset
* You should prepare dataset VOC-2012 and COCO-2017 first.
* Please email the author for access to raw matting dataset.
* Composite the dataset for training and test
  ```
  python tools/composite.py
  ```

### Pretrained model
```
python tools/chg_model.py
```
